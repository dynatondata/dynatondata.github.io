# 16. Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Dynaton is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Dynaton utilizes Amazon Inspector to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems. We also utilize Amazon Guard Duty in our AWS environment for intelligent threat detection and continuous monitoring. Dynaton utilizes the NPM audit functionality to scan for vulnerabilities in source code.
